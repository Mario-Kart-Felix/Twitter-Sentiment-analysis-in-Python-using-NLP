You can download the dataset from http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip

Note : I have used ony a tiny part of the dataset for prediction due to memory constraints. You can use cloud based platform to use the complete dataset for running your algorithm

The dataset is divided into train and test data. We have combined train and test data at the start and extracted tiny portion of the data

| __Column number__  | __Detail__                                                                      |
